# English-Dictionary-App

## Introduction:

The objective of the project is to create an english dictionary app that returns definitions of english words.

## Project Flow:

* Main Menu

1. Add a new word
2. Find the meaning
3. Update a word
4. Exit

* Enter a choice:

1. If choice 1 is entered then it will ask the user to enter a word and its meaning. This pair of word and its meaning will be stored in a dictionary. The dictionary    will be dumped in a text file called 'words.txt' using the dump function of json module.

2. If choice 2 is entered then it will ask the user to enter a word and then search that word in the text file 'words.txt' andÂ return the meaning if present else        display appropriate message. The text file will be converted into python data using load function of json module.

3. If choice 3 is entered then it will accept a word and update its meaning using serialization and deserialization. In all the above three cases, the prompt should return to the main menu. 

4. If choice 4 is entered then a graceful exit will be performed.
